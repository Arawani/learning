# Containerization

Containerization refers to the process of packaging an application and all its dependencies (libraries, frameworks, configuration files) into a self-contained, isolated unit called a container.

This ensures that the application runs consistently across different computing environments, from a developer's local machine to a production server, regardless of the underlying operating system or infrastructure.
